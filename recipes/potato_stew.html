        <li>1 medium yellow onion(150g)</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, thinly slices</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>700g potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>750ml water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>

        <li>100g dino kale (7-8 leaves)</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>If you're using frozen chorizo:</strong> n a medium pan, cook the sausages over medium heat in a splash of olive oil, turning every few minutes until they're defrosted through. Remove from the pan and cut into ~1 cm thick slices. Return the chorizo to the pan and cook for a few minutes until they are a little golden and crispy on the outside. Set aside.</li><br>
        <li><strong>If you're using thawed/refridgerated chorizo:</strong> skip ahead to slicing the sausage and then brown in the pan as explained above. Set aside. </li><br>
        <li>Heat up 3 tbsp olive oil in a pot and sauté the onion over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add in garlic and sauté for an additional minute. Add in tomato paste and fry for 30 seconds, stirring constantly. Add the chorizo into the pot, along with potatoes, water, both paprika powders and salt. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer.
        </li><br>
        <li>Simmer uncovered for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are cooked through. Take the pot off the heat and stir in the dino kale. Serve immediately.</li>
